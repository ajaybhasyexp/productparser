# ProductParser
This project is a part of me learning Node.js. It is a library to parse various resources from web and create a database of products.<br/>
For now I am only parsing products from an ecommerce website. I plan to parse products from other sources like
* IMDB
* Google Places
* Parse Amazon Webpages

This database is being used for another project that I am doing as a hobby to practice Angular and MongoDB. This is a website where people can write
reviews about various products in a gamified environment like StackOverflow.

I will keep updating this and try to make it into a reusable component according to my free time.
